# Thinker-Agent

A less serious little hobby project (based on AI generated code, but reworked):
Essentially an LLM workflow to “automate” brooding.
Simply write in your current thoughts as chaotically as they are, wait for further questions, let it brood and relax.
It generates a Markdown report with all the analysis when it's done.
The LLM should ideally be run locally via LLMStudio (default is gemma-3-12b-it-qat).
